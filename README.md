# Fitplan

An app designed to help people who work out at home program their own workouts. The idea is that the user:

1. Creates a workout
2. Creates a plan for any combination of days of the week
3. Assigns workouts to their plan
4. Drags their plan into one of the 4 week rows to organize them

I built this app with Blitz.js (pre-RPC), Tailwind, and React Final Form.
