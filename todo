--> Replace modals with slide-in forms. Consider react-spring. 

< On workout select from workouts page, slide in on click rather than directing to page

Fix size difference between dashboard and pages (padding ?)

Create oops page for 400, 404, and 500 responses. Maybe do a loading page then redirect to static on timeout

Implement left chevron on individual pages as back button to dashboard

Reduce login and logout errors -> Unmount avatar and nav on logout to avoid error; do reverse for login.

Set up responsive styling for small to medium mobile devices

Workouts: Choose existing exercises or refactor to just put exercises directly in workouts?
< Exercises: Assign to existing workouts

Finish implementation of change password (it's not getting the token)

Implement multitenancy https://blitzjs.com/docs/multitenancy

Clean up code, insert comments, remove unused imports and console.log code from each file. Fix var and func naming and make code more readable, esp. in plans.

Re-enter password check in the sign up form


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Nice to haves

Current workouts functionality: Implement timer with animation?

Clean up and compontentitize code

Write custom deletion dialog

Add meals and allow scheduling into week; include macro tracking (use USDA FoodData Central API); call tab "Nutrition"

Implement reorder capability on all pages

Add search (Lunr)

Create dark mode mode for improved a11y

Add Recovery type




-- Notes and scraps

State is broken in plans. Items not persisting reorder within group now. App gets stuck at rebuilding. Likely due to stale closure. Tried useEffect in several different ways, but can't find source of issue. 
!!! Fixed render by removing index [0] from planItems, items, and group. 
Group and item order are persisting in state, but not to db. Itemorder and group order remain null. 
!!! Fixed - had to add itemOrder and groupOrder to update mutation. 
Need to check if update from edit page causes issues. Still need to fix inter-group ordering (itemOrder). 
!!! Fixed - put postupdatedorder call inside conditional. Changed sortby from id to itemorder.
