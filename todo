-- Plan

Style plans for 2-col
Assign exercises to workouts 
Responsive styling cleanup; responsive nav
Deploy
Work on Nice-to-haves, bug fixes, and other improvements

------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Required features

Fix broken modals. Cancel and close buttons don't work, but clicking outside modal does. Could be related to new Blitz routing scheme or breaking changes in new React router DOM. Maybe just remove this and do some in-page animations with dynamic behaviors.

Fix size difference between dashboard and pages (padding ?)

Create oops page for 400, 404, and 500 responses. Maybe do a loading page then redirect to static on timeout

Implement left chevron on individual pages as back button to dashboard

Force page refresh after create/delete/edit in all. useEffect not working. May need to bubble up state from forms. This only occurs now in Plans. May be related to modal.

Reduce login and logout errors -> Unmount avatar and nav on logout to avoid error; do reverse for login.

Set up responsive styling for small to medium mobile devices

Workouts: Choose existing exercises or refactor to just put exercises directly in workouts?
< Exercises: Assign to existing workouts

Finish implementation of change password (it's not getting the token)

Implement multitenancy https://blitzjs.com/docs/multitenancy

Clean up code, insert comments, remove unused imports and console.log code from each file. Fix var and func naming and make code more readable, esp. in plans.

< On workout select from workouts page, open modal on click rather than directing to page


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Nice to haves

Clean up and compontentitize code

Write custom deletion dialog

Add meals and allow scheduling into week; include macro tracking (use USDA FoodData Central API); call tab "Nutrition"

Allow user to add workout to plan from workouts view page

Integrate editing with view page so user can click in a field, change, then save without requiring separate edit action

Add ability to add existing exercise to workout

Create dark mode mode for improved a11y

Add Recovery type

Custom scrollbar pill styling




-- Notes and scraps

State is broken in plans. Items not persisting reorder within group now. App gets stuck at rebuilding. Likely due to stale closure. Tried useEffect in several different ways, but can't find source of issue. Fixed render by removing index [0] from planItems, items, and group. Group and item order are persisting in state, but not to db. Itemorder and group order remain null. Fixed - had to add itemOrder and groupOrder to update mutation. Need to check if update from edit page causes issues. Still need to fix inter-group ordering (itemOrder). Fixed - put postupdatedorder call inside conditional. Changed sortby from id to itemorder.
